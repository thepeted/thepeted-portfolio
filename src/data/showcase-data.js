      'My goal was to create a playable Noughts & Crosses game against an unbeatable AI in order to improve my understanding of recursion and to practice translating an outline algorithm to JavaScript.  Since Noughts & Crosses is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero sum game</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a> algorithm is a good choice for determining each move made by the AI.  There is scope for improving the performance of the algorithm by implementing alpha-beta pruning in order to reduce the number of cases evaluated in each search.',

      'A <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a> visualisation of global meteorite strike locations over time - the larger the circle, the greater the mass of the discovered object.  The map includes tooltips for each data point and I took care to make sure the overlapping circles are arranged with the smallest masses on top.  D3&#8217;s clever approach of binding data to DOM elements and it&#8217;s JQuery like syntax makes the library a good choice if you&#8217;re looking for a performant and flexible open source visualisation tool.  <a href="http://codepen.io/collection/XjzkRb/">See more of my D3 visualisations here</a>.',

The UI features keyboard controls, a responsive viewport that tracks the player position, a "fog mode" and messaging / scoreboard. Writing this app taught me lots about functional programming and creating organised code. Give it a go - the game is challenging but winnable!',
